# Tubelight Simulation
We try to simulate a 1-Dimensional Model of a Tubelight. A uniform Electric Field
exists across the length of the Tubelight. Electrons are Injected at the cathode
end of the tube light, which initially has zero energy. Due to the Electric Field,
the electrons gain Kinetic Energy. When the Electrons gain a Threshold Energy,
say E0, upon collision with Atoms in the Tube lights, the energy of the Electron
is completely transferred to the atom which excites the atom, resulting in Light
Emission. The Uncollided Electrons hit the other end of the tube light and loose
all the energy. We try to simulate the Tube Light in Python. We plot the Light
Intensity vs Position, Electron Density Vs Position, Phase space Diagram.
