# Analyzing LTI System
Using Python we can solve Circuits, get Transfer Functions, by formulating Matrices. In this assignment, we try to find Output to a High and Low pass Filters,
with majorly using sympy functions. The idea is to form expressions of Transfer
Functions or Output, with help of the ‘symbol()’ function, and then convert it
into an LTI system. With the help of ‘lsim()’ or ‘step()’ functions, we can find
the output response.
