# Resistor Problem
We have a metal plate. A circular electrode (of 1V) is placed at the center of the
metal Plate. The bottom of the Metal plate is grounded. We find the potential of
the plate using Laplace Equation and with the given boundary conditions. We plot
the Contour, 3D plot of the Potential Function. We find the Current in the Metal,
and plot the quiver plot for the same. We also find the Error in the potential after
each Iteration and then plot the loglog and semilog plots.
